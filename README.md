Hello! I'm Watermel00n and I have been working on this tech tree mod for about 4 months now.

2. Having a unkerballed start and planes before space tech tree.

3. Adding new fuels, adding new depth to the game

4. QOL patches

5. Making monopropellant more used.

 

Progress:

Tech Tree nodes - Done

Movement of parts - 90%

New parts - 90%
