			@description = Maybe you should try some crunchy solid boosters. Or some juicy liquid engines? To get to space, you need lots and lots of thrust. And the tech you unlock in the nodes after this gives you just that.

			@description = NEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW! These parts allow you to traverse long distances - BY AIR! And if you don't think that's cool, think about the thing Jeb could do in one of those! Just don't forget to learn how to build a plane, 'cause it's harder than a rocket.
